# Json Parser

Just learning Haskell.

Prerequisites:

> GHC
> Cabal

How to Run:

```
cabal run [projectname] [filename]
```
This will take a filename as argument and parse it.

```
cabal run
```
Using cabal run with no arguments will just request you to input a JSON string.

Or
```
cabal install --installdir=.
```
And just use the executable.
